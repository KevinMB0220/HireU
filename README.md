## Features
- Post and manage projects with detailed requirements
- Handle applications and milestone agreements
- Escrow funds via smart contracts with conditional release
- Reputation system backed by verifiable metrics
- Integrated wallet creation, import, and auto-connection flows
- Responsive interface with built-in dark mode

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + TypeScript
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, shadcn/ui
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **On-chain:** Smart contracts on Avalanche with tokenized payments in USDT (Tether)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
Create `.env.local` in the project root:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=local
```
Use `fuji` or `mainnet` as needed.

## Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
App available at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
### Wallet
1. Navigate to `/wallet`
2. Create or import a wallet
3. The wallet connects automatically
4. You are redirected to the main dashboard

### Smart contracts workflow
```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npm run compile
npm run deploy:local   # or deploy:fuji, deploy:mainnet
```

## Main components
### Wallet
- **WalletManager** (`src/components/wallet/WalletManager.tsx`) — Full wallet management page
- **WalletButton** (`src/components/wallet/WalletButton.tsx`) — Navbar entry point
- **WdkContext** (`src/contexts/WdkContext.tsx`) — Global wallet state

### Hooks
- `useWdk()` — Access wallet context
- `useWdkAccount()` — Current account retrieval
- `useWdkBalance()` — Formatted balance handling
- `useWdkNetwork()` — Network management
- `useWdkProvider()` — Provider and signer (ethers.js)
- `useScaffoldReadContract()` — Read smart contracts
- `useScaffoldWriteContract()` — Write to smart contracts

## Configured networks
- **Local:** `http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc` (Chain ID: 1337)
- **Fuji:** `https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc` (Chain ID: 43113)
- **Mainnet:** `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc` (Chain ID: 43114)

## Smart contracts
Five contracts in `contracts/src/`:
1. **UserRegistry.sol** — User registration
2. **UserStatistics.sol** — Freelancer statistics
3. **ProjectManager.sol** — Project management
4. **EscrowPayment.sol** — Escrow payments
5. **WorkVerification.sol** — Work verification

Refer to `contracts/README.md` for extended documentation.

## WDK implementation
The Wallet Development Kit (WDK) is implemented in-house using:
- `ethers.js` v6 for wallet and provider management
- `@scure/bip39` for seed phrase generation
- BIP44 derivation for accounts

Source located at `src/lib/wdk.ts`, compatible with the official WDK API expectations.

## Security notes
- Seed phrases encrypted with AES-GCM (Web Crypto API) or `crypto-js` fallback over HTTP
- Stored in `localStorage` (consider IndexedDB for production)
- Auto-unlock available only in development
- Manual lock flow enforced in production
- Balance refresh every 10 seconds when connected; silent handling of RPC errors during development
